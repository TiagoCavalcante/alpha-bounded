\par In this paper we establish the definition of $(\alpha, \lambda)$-bounded functions,
find some immediate results from this definition, and discover the asymptotic characterization of the amount of k-bounded functions on \([n]\) considering the Manhattan distance using tools from algebraic combinatorics, such as Toeplitz matrices, and from graph theory.
