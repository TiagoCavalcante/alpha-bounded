\par In this work, we introduce the concept of $(\alpha, \lambda)$-bounded functions, characterized by limited local variation, which is especially useful in discrete sets. Initially, we formally define these functions and investigate their fundamental properties, highlighting significant differences from continuous functions. The main result obtained is the asymptotic characterization of $a(n, k)$, representing the number of functions from $[n]$ to $[n]$ that are $k$-bounded with respect to the Manhattan distance. The proof of this result combines Toeplitz matrices with a well-known inequality from graph theory. Additionally, we emphasize the relevance of the intersection among algebraic combinatorics, graph theory, and the analysis of discrete metric spaces, suggesting future research into the topological properties of these functions and their potential applications in computational and mathematical contexts.
